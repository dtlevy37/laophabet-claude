## 2026-10-24

### Added
- App-phase agent config, staged for the owner to install (`_agent/proposed-config/INSTALL.md`):
  - New CLAUDE.md built around the app and curriculum tracks and the slice/gate workflow.
  - New read-only agents `code-reviewer` and `curriculum-reviewer`. `drafter` retargeted at lesson needs; `researcher` and `scholar` now also cover technical sources.
  - Six skills: app-slice, sql-migration, frontend-feature, activity-module, build-lesson, draft-content.
  - Guard config allowing the new agents.
- `CLAUDE_Research.md`: the previous CLAUDE.md, preserved unchanged for research and word-list work (not auto-loaded).
- Proposed script `_agent/proposed-scripts/check_frontend.js`: JS syntax, import/export and strings.json key checks for `app/frontend` (awaiting approval).
- APP_DESIGN: "Practice sessions" and "Stats and encouragement" (streak, letters known, words known, session summary). Confirmed by the user: letters known is one number; words read counts repeats.

### Changed
- APP_PLAN slices: S5 adds sessions and the session summary; S6 adds the summary screen; S8 adds home stats; new S8b practice sessions.

### Fixed
- App no longer hangs when Supabase is unreachable. Sign-up and login now show an error and re-enable the submit button instead of leaving the form stuck. A failed profile fetch shows an error with "Try again" and "Sign out" instead of an endless loading screen. A failed `getSession` at startup falls through to the login screen. (`app/frontend/js/auth.js`, `app/frontend/js/app.js`)

### Added
- `retry` UI string ("Try again" / "ລອງໃໝ່", Lao unverified). (`app/frontend/js/strings.json`)
- This changelog.
