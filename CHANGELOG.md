### Fixed
- App no longer hangs when Supabase is unreachable. Sign-up and login now show an error and re-enable the submit button instead of leaving the form stuck. A failed profile fetch shows an error with "Try again" and "Sign out" instead of an endless loading screen. A failed `getSession` at startup falls through to the login screen. (`app/frontend/js/auth.js`, `app/frontend/js/app.js`)

### Added
- `retry` UI string ("Try again" / "ລອງໃໝ່", Lao unverified). (`app/frontend/js/strings.json`)
- This changelog.
