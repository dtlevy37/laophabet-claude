# Questions

Doubts only a person can settle. The agent appends; the owner clears what is handled. Older word-list review items
(batches c1–c6, classifiers, tone-source disagreements) are parked in `_shelf/docs/NEEDS_HUMAN.md`.

## For the owner
- (nothing open; A4 accent answered: Midwest US, Iowa)

## For the native speaker
- **Wife's answer, 2026-11-12 (context of "this is white")**: ນີ້ຂາວ (*nii khǎao*) is fine when talking about the colour of
  something like a wall; if you are holding an object you say ນີ້ມັນສີຂາວ (*nii man sǐi khǎao*). Spelling written from the
  owner's romanization, `unverified`. To do: look through the lesson sentences for this "this is <colour>" pattern and
  decide whether any need the ມັນສີ form or a context note. She says phrases generally depend on what you want to say.
- ເຕ້ຍ W001427 "short (in height), low" (owner asked, 2026-11-12; not on Wiktionary): reading tia˥˨ high-falling, and the sentences ລາວເຕ້ຍ S000002899, ພໍ່ເຕ້ຍ S000002900.
- ເຂົາ (W000160): the owner has only heard it as "they/them", with ລາວ as the everyday "he/she". The gloss was changed
  from Wiktionary's "he; she; they" to "they; (more formal) he; she". Is that right for Vientiane speech?
- Composed lesson sentences to confirm: ກິນເຂົ້າ "to eat (a meal)" (S000002870), ລາວກິນເຂົ້າ "He eats. / She eats."
  (lesson 3), ເຂົາກິນເຂົ້າ "They eat." (S000002871, held for a later lesson).
- ລາວ "he, she" (W000031) is recorded with a short vowel (law, "lao") and ລາວ "Lao" (W000058) with a long one
  (laːw, "laao"), per Wiktionary. Is the pronoun really shorter in normal speech? The lesson 3 card shows one
  respelling ("lao") for both, and the ◌າ card avoids the word "long" because of this.
  **Being asked 2026-11-12** (the owner's wife). The owner leans to long "laao" by the spelling rules, which would
  make ຂາວ (kaao, white) / ລາວ (laao, he/she) a pair differing only in first consonant and tone. Ready to apply:
  `python tmp/laao_change.py` (word row + 166 sentences).
- Lesson 4 (composed): is ກິນນ້ຳ the everyday way to say "drink water" (versus ດື່ມນ້ຳ)? Is ລາວຂາວ natural for "he/she is
  fair-skinned"? Would anyone say ເຂົ້າຂາວ for white rice, or only ເຂົ້າຈ້າວ (S000002875, taken out of the lesson)? Is ລາວກິນນ້ຳ natural? Does ◌ຳ in ນ້ຳ sound like the "um" in "hum", and is "nam" a fair spelling of it?
- Lesson 5 (composed): are ລາວກິນເຂົ້າແລ້ວ "He/She has eaten already" (S000002877) and ລາວກິນນ້ຳແລ້ວ "He/She has had some
  water already" (S000002878) natural? Is the bare reply ກິນແລ້ວ "I've eaten (already)" (S000000024) natural? Tags to
  confirm: ແລ້ວ (W000020) as a function word (never blanked), ແກ້ວ (W000218) as an object; in the blank __ ແລ້ວ only
  nouns (ນ້ຳ, ຂາ, ແກ້ວ) are offered as wrong options: does any of them make a sensible reply? Does ແ in ແລ້ວ sound like the
  a in "cat", held long?
- Tone of ເຂົ້າ (low-falling) and ເກົ້າ (high-falling) as stored: do they match Vientiane speech?
- **ບໍ່ vs ບໍ** (question marker): Wiktionary has only ບໍ່ for both "no" and the question sense; other sources often write
  the question marker without the tone mark. The data uses ບໍ່ for both. Which is right?
- Lesson 6 softener: ແນ່ (W001426, nae, newly drafted, IPA by agent) or ແດ່ (W000308, dae): which is everyday Vientiane
  speech for softening a request, and how is each spelled? Is ຂໍນ້ຳແນ່ "Could I have some water?" (S000002880) /
  ຂໍເຂົ້າແນ່ "Could I have some rice?" (S000002881) natural?
- Does bare ຂໍນ້ຳ (khor nam, "water please"; S000000012) sound abrupt without a softener?
- Is ຫິວເຂົ້າ (hiu khao) the normal way to say "hungry"? (needed in lesson 9)
- Lesson 6 question word: in ກິນເຂົ້າແລ້ວບໍ່? "Have you eaten yet?" (S000000023), is the question word written ບໍ່ (with
  the tone mark, as the data has it) or unmarked ບໍ, and is it said differently from ບໍ່ "not"?
- Lesson 6 (composed): is ລາວບໍ່ກິນເຂົ້າ "He/She doesn't eat" (S000002879) natural?
- Lesson 6 tags: ບໍ່ (W000003) and ແນ່ (W001426) as function words; ຂໍ (W000009) as a verb with no verb class; ບ້ານ
  (W000049) as a place.
- Fill in the blank hazard: ນ້ຳ (Nam) and ແກ້ວ (Kaew) are also common personal names, so they can make sense in any
  subject slot (ນ້ຳບໍ່ກິນເຂົ້າ "Nam doesn't eat"). They are now excluded in S000002879, S000000023 and S000000024 slot 1.
  Are there other pool words (ຂາວ, ບ້ານ ...) that are common names or nicknames?
- Lesson 7 (composed): does ດີແລ້ວ (dee leo, S000002882) mean "That's fine. / That's good." (agreeing, or "good enough,
  stop")? Is ນ້ຳນີ້ດີ (nam nee dee, "This water is good", S000002883) natural, or would one say ນ້ຳນີ້ແຊບ / ນ້ຳນີ້ສະອາດ?
  Is ຂໍນ້ຳນີ້ແນ່ (khor nam nee nae, "Could I have this water?", S000002884) natural, or is a classifier needed
  (ຂໍນ້ຳແກ້ວນີ້ແນ່)? ບໍ່ດີ (bor dee, "Not good", S000000004, existing) as a bare reply.
- Lesson 7: is ດາວ (dao, star; W000546) also a common personal name (Dao)? It is excluded from subject slots as one.
  Tags: ດາວ and ດິນ (din, soil; W000550) as objects (ດິນ not place), ນີ້ (nee, this; W000016) as a function word.
- Lesson 7 tones and lengths: ດີ (dee, good) is stored low-rising (diː˩(˧)); is that how it is said in Vientiane?
  ດິນ (din, soil) is short and ດາວ (dao, star) long, per Wiktionary: do they sound that way?
- Lesson 8 conversation: ສະບາຍດີ (sabaidee, "Hello", S000000001) / ສະບາຍດີ / ສະບາຍດີບໍ່? (sabaidee bor?, "How are
  you?", S000000003) / ສະບາຍດີ (sabaidee, "I'm well", S000002885, composed). Is the bare ສະບາຍດີ the normal reply to
  ສະບາຍດີບໍ່?, or is ສະບາຍດີ ຂອບໃຈ (sabaidee khop jai, "I'm well, thank you") more usual? Does answering a hello with
  the same ສະບາຍດີ sound natural? Is ສະບາຍດີບໍ່? natural on its own, or is ເຈົ້າສະບາຍດີບໍ່? (jao sabaidee bor?) expected?
  Is the question marker here ບໍ່ or ບໍ (see the ບໍ່ vs ບໍ items above)?
- Lesson 8 sounds: is there an audible catch (glottal stop) at the end of ສະ (sa) in ສະບາຍດີ, as the cut-off card (R01)
  says, or does it run into the next syllable in normal speech? Does final ຍ in ບາຍ (baai) / ຂາຍ (khaai, sell) sound
  like the y at the end of "bye"?
- Lesson 8 tags: ສະບາຍ (W000512) and ສະບາຍດີ (W000001) as qualities (states), ຂາຍ (W000084) as a verb with no verb
  class. In the one-word blanks for "Hello" / "I'm well", ດີ (dee, good) and ສະບາຍ (sabai, well) are accepted as
  answers: is either a sensible one-word reply to ສະບາຍດີບໍ່?
- Lesson 9 (composed): are ລາວຫິວເຂົ້າ (lao hiu khao, "He/She is hungry", S000002886), ເຈົ້າຫິວເຂົ້າບໍ່? (jao hiu khao
  bor?, "Are you hungry?", S000002887) and the bare reply ບໍ່ຫິວ. (bor hiu, "Not hungry", S000002888) natural, or does
  the reply need more (ບໍ່ຫິວເທື່ອ, ຂ້ອຍບໍ່ຫິວ)? Is ເຈົ້າຫິວນ້ຳບໍ່? (jao hiu nam bor?, "Are you thirsty?", S000001170,
  existing) natural?
- Lesson 9 thirst: is ຫິວນ້ຳ (hiu nam) the everyday Vientiane word for "thirsty", or ຢາກນ້ຳ (yaak nam)? The reply to
  "Are you thirsty?" is ຫິວນ້ຳ. (hiu nam, "Yes, I'm thirsty", S000002889): would a bare ຫິວ. (hiu) also work as that
  reply, or does it only ever mean "hungry"?
- Lesson 9: would anyone say ລາວຫິວກິນ (lao hiu kin, "he's hungry to eat")? ກິນ is kept out of the ຫິວ __ blanks in
  case it would.
- Lesson 9 register: is ເຈົ້າ (jao, "you") polite enough with strangers and older people (shop staff, a waiter), or
  would one say ທ່ານ (thaan) or a kin term (ເອື້ອຍ, ອ້າຍ)? Tag: ເຈົ້າ (W000005) is tagged person|function (it is also the
  polite "yes"), so it is never a wrong option.
- Lesson 9 sounds: does ຈ (jor) in ເຈົ້າ / ຈານ sound between the j in "jaw" and the ch in "chew", as the card says?
- Lesson 10 (composed): is the bare reply ຫິວ. (hiu, "Yes, I'm hungry. / Hungry.", S000002892) natural as the answer to
  ເຈົ້າຫິວເຂົ້າບໍ່? (jao hiu khao bor?, "Are you hungry?"), or would one say ຫິວເຂົ້າ / ຫິວແລ້ວ / ເຈົ້າ ຫິວ?
- Lesson 10 (composed): ຂ້ອຍກິນເຂົ້າແລ້ວ (khoy kin khao leo, "I've eaten already", S000002890) is the last line of the
  conversation, after ບໍ່ຫິວ (bor hiu, "Not hungry"). Is the full form natural there, or would one just say ກິນແລ້ວ
  (kin leo, "Eaten already")?
- Lesson 10 (composed): does ລາວນອນແລ້ວ (lao non leo, S000002891) mean "He's asleep already" (now the English), or
  "He has gone to bed" (which we think is ເຂົ້ານອນແລ້ວ, khao non leo)?
- Lesson 10 register: ຂ້ອຍ (khoy, "I", W000006) is labelled colloquial on Wiktionary. Is it fine with strangers and
  older people, or is ຂ້າພະເຈົ້າ / a kin term expected? Also confirm ຂ້ອຍຫິວເຂົ້າ (S000000113) and ຂ້ອຍສະບາຍດີ
  (S000000008), both existing and unverified.
- Lesson 10: ນ້ອຍ (noy, "small", W000090) is treated as a common personal name (Noy), so it is kept out of subject and
  person slots (exclude_word_ids, 38 earlier slots updated). Is that right? Also: ນ້ອຍ is a wrong option in
  ກິນ __ (kin __) blanks; is "ກິນນ້ອຍ" ever said, or only ກິນໜ້ອຍ (kin noy, "eat a little")? Tags: ຂ້ອຍ person,
  ນອນ action (no verb class), ນ້ອຍ quality.
- **Lesson 11 (L0011)**, all composed by the agent: ສີນີ້ຂາວ (sii nee khao, "This colour is white"; S000002893),
  ສີນີ້ດຳ (sii nee dam, "This colour is black"; S000002894), ສີນີ້ດີ (sii nee dee, "This colour is good"; S000002895;
  the pool has ສີນີ້ງາມ "beautiful": which is more natural?), ລາວຂາຍເຂົ້າ (lao khaai khao, "She sells rice";
  S000002896), ແກ້ວນີ້ນ້ອຍ (kaew nee noy, "This glass is small"; S000002898). (1) Asked "what colour?", do people
  answer with the bare ສີຂາວ (sii khao) or just ຂາວ (khao)? (2) ຂໍແກ້ວນ້ອຍແນ່ (khor kaew noy nae; S000002897): does it
  mean "Could I have a small glass?", or is it heard as "a little glass(ful)" / something else? (3) ເຂົ້າຂາວ (khao
  khao, "white rice"; S000002875, not used in any lesson): real, or is plain rice always ເຂົ້າຈ້າວ (khao jaao)?
  (4) Are ດຳ (Dam) and ຂາວ (Khao) common nicknames? Both are now kept out as wrong options wherever a name could fit
  (W000539, W000538 in exclude_word_ids). (5) Does ສີ (sii, colour) have an impolite or rude sense to avoid? The agent
  tagged it with the verb sense "to rub; to mill (rice)" (ສີເຂົ້າ) and ດຳ with "to dive" (ດຳນ້ຳ): right?
- **Letter writing (`#/write`)**: the stroke paths come from a font, not from a handwriting model. Please check on the
  screen, letter by letter: (1) does each letter start where a Lao writer starts it (the app starts at the loop;
  ກ gor starts bottom left; ມ mor starts top left; ອ or starts at the curl bottom left) and run in the right
  direction? (2) is every consonant really one stroke without lifting the pen? (3) ພ por, ຟ for, ຜ por, ຝ for: is the
  middle peak drawn up and back down the same line? (4) the shapes are Noto Sans Lao Looped; its ກ gor had two loops,
  so ກ alone was taken from the plain Noto Sans Lao. Do ຖ tor (loop at the top left) and the others look like
  normal school handwriting?
- **Word-order notes (A2, shown when a learner builds a sentence in the wrong order)**: the app tells the learner
  these rules. Are they right as stated, and is any of them misleading? (1) A describing word comes after the thing:
  ນ້ຳນີ້ (nam nee, "this water"), not ນີ້ນ້ຳ; ແກ້ວນ້ອຍ (gaew noy, "small glass"). (2) ບໍ່ (bor, "not") goes before the
  word it negates: ບໍ່ດີ (bor dee, "not good"). (3) As a question word ບໍ່ goes at the very end: ດີບໍ່? (dee bor, "is
  it good?"). (4) ແນ່ (nae, softening "please") goes at the end of a request: ຂໍນ້ຳແນ່ (khor nam nae, "may I have some
  water"). (5) ແລ້ວ (laew, "already") usually comes after the word it belongs to: ກິນແລ້ວ (gin laew, "ate already").
  Also: would ນ້ຳດີນີ້ (nam dee nee) be read as "this good water"? The app does not call that order wrong.
- **Sounds-like hints (A4 audit, `docs/A4_SOUNDS_LIKE_AUDIT.md`)**, please say each word aloud for the owner:
  1. **ແ vs ເ:** in ແລ້ວ (laew, "already"), ແນ່ (nae, request softener) and ແກ້ວ (gaew, "glass"), is the vowel closer to English "bed" said long, or to "cat"? Please say a ແ◌ word and a ເ◌ word side by side so the owner can hear the gap. (The existing lesson 5 question about ແລ້ວ and 'cat' can be merged into this one.)
  2. **◌ໍ / ◌ອ◌:** in ບໍ່ (baw, "not"), ຂໍ (kaw, "may I have") and ນອນ (nawn, "sleep"), is the vowel nearer an open "ah" with rounded lips, or nearer "oh"? Does it sound like ບໍ່ when the owner says "baw" in their own accent?
  3. **Short ◌ິ:** in ກິນ (gin, "eat") and ດິນ (din, "earth"), does English "gin"/"din" sound right, or does the vowel need to be tighter (nearer "keen"/"deen" but short)?
  4. **ດຳ (dam, "black"):** is the vowel the same as in ນ້ຳ (nam, "water"), i.e. the "u" of "hum", not English "dam"?
  5. **ບ/ປ and ດ/ຕ:** when the owner says English "boy" and "deck", do they sound like ບ/ດ or like ປ/ຕ to her? (This decides whether the ບ/ດ cards need "a full, buzzing b/d".)
  6. **Short ◌ຸ** (for later): is it like the "u" in "put", or tighter?
- **Usage notes (A5, shown on the word cards)**: are these right, and is anything missing or odd? (1) ສະບາຍດີ
  (sa-baai-dii): "Literally 'be well': the everyday greeting for both hello and goodbye. It is said with the palms
  pressed together at the chest and a slight bow, the ນົບ (nop)." Is it used for goodbye as much as for hello? (2)
  ເຂົ້າ (kao, "rice"): "Rice, and by extension a meal: ກິນເຂົ້າ (gin kao, 'eat rice') means 'have a meal'. The general
  word for food is ອາຫານ (aa-haan)."
- **Hunger, pronouns and tense (owner's play-test, 2026-11-13).** ANSWERED (1), 2026-11-13: ຂ້ອຍຫິວ alone sounds
  incomplete ("hungry for what?"); say ຫິວເຂົ້າ / ຫິວນ້ຳ. (2) and (3) still open. (1) Is ຂ້ອຍຫິວ (khoy hiw, "I'm hungry") alone
  natural, or would you wonder "hungry for what?" and expect ຂ້ອຍຫິວເຂົ້າ (khoy hiw khao)? Lessons already use bare
  ຫິວ as a reply: ຫິວ (hiw, "hungry") answering ເຈົ້າຫິວເຂົ້າບໍ່? (jao hiw khao baw, "are you hungry?"), ບໍ່ຫິວ (baw
  hiw, "not hungry"), and ເດັກນ້ອຍຫິວ (dek noy hiw, "the little child is hungry"). (2) ລາວບໍ່ກິນເຂົ້າ (lao baw gin
  khao): "he doesn't eat (meals)", "he isn't eating", or "he hasn't eaten"? We use ຂ້ອຍຍັງບໍ່ກິນເຂົ້າ (khoy nyang baw
  gin khao) for "I haven't eaten yet". (3) Is ສະບາຍດີບໍ່? (sabaidee baw, "how are you?", no "you") as natural as
  ເຈົ້າສະບາຍດີບໍ່? (jao sabaidee baw)? When is the pronoun dropped, and when would dropping it sound odd?
